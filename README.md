1. It seems to me that everything works out correctly. I have tested a few times and everything makes sense. Sometimes i get
error in the wallet, which is probably due to incorrect math somewhere in my ButtonPanel.java.
2. I believe that my work is set apart because it prints face down to start and it actually makes sense in the math.
The interface is simple, and the information you need is given to you explicitly.
3. Classes are used to create complicated programs by being able to create objects that have indepedant variables and methods.
This allows us to organize the ideas into more simple java files and not create one massive pile of code.
Without htis ability, this project would have taken far more time, and the code would not be comprehendible.
4. A public variable can be called from other java files, while a private one is independant to a file, and must be
called using "getters" and "setters".
5. A class has the code that makes up the objects. Instance has variables, and is an object that can be called and created.
6. Inheritance is when a class uses or extends another class so that you do not have to waste
time rewriting the code again.
7. "This" calls the private variable in a class. You must call the variable using this.X instead of just X. Super 
calls the constructor for the parent file. It makes sure that you make the parent file before the daughter.
